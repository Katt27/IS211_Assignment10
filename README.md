# IS211 Assignment10 - Relational Databases with SQLite

This repository contains the coursework for Week 10 of IS211. It involves working with relational databases using SQLite, focusing on two main parts: creating a schema for a music database and interacting with a pre-defined pets database.

## Overview

The project is divided into two main sections:

### Part I: Music Database

This section involves designing a relational schema to model music artists, their albums, and the songs on those albums. The task is to create a SQL script that initializes a database with the appropriate tables and relationships.

### Part II: Pets Database

This part uses an existing schema for a database that manages information about people and their pets. The tasks include writing Python scripts to load data into the database and querying this data based on user input.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- SQLite3

Ensure Python and SQLite are installed on your system. Python can be downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and SQLite comes bundled with Python.
